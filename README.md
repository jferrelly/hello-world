# hello-world

This is my test GitHub repository. I've created it on GitHub desktop and now published it to GitHub. After commiting and having readme-edits as the default branch I've changed the default to the master branch and created another new readme-edits branch.

Now that I've made some commits using the online GitHub I'm adding new commits using GitHub Desktop.
